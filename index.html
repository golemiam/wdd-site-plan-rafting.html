            I was raised in Salt Lake City and think of it as home, 
            I live in Millcreek Utah now, not far from it. I got my 
            first bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary studies 
            with an emphasis in Special Education from Utah State 
            University. I have started coming back to school for a 
            second bachelors degree in programming, and I started 
            studying it about 3 years ago when I took my first HTML 
            class.

            I have a family where I have a wife and 2 kids, they are 
            wonderful. I served a mission in Arkansas Little Rock, 
            english speaking. I picked up a hobby of learning languages
            about 8 years ago. I am most fluent in spanish, italian, 
            and german. (Aside from English that is.)
